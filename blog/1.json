		"GogglePal, an exciting new wearable product, is the world’s first universally mountable heads-up display dashboard designed for snowsports enthusiasts. The small and lightweight goggle mount allows skiers and snowboarders to track and share on-slope stats with friends all over the world!",
		"The two-part device comes with a magnetically mounted head’s-up display screen that sits in the lower corner of the user’s goggle lens and a strap-mounted controller pod that tracks and shares information via a smartphone app. Its augmented reality technology allows GogglePal to display in real time user’s speed, vertical drop, calories burned and acceleration while skiing or snowboarding.",
		"At the end of the day, the GogglePal app organizes daily ski stats so friends can compare days while maximizing performance. It also helps users locate friends and family members, play on-mountain games and challenge others while skiing and riding."
